# DhanSaathi - AI-Powered Financial Assistant

## What is DhanSaathi?

DhanSaathi is a user-friendly financial platform designed to help people in India manage their money and make smart investment choices. Many people in India are new to investing and don’t know where to start. DhanSaathi solves this by analyzing your spending habits and giving you personalized investment advice using AI. It’s like having a financial guide in your pocket, available 24/7!

Our goal is to make financial planning easy, teach users about money, and help them grow their wealth, even if they have little or no knowledge about investments.

## Why DhanSaathi?

In India, millions of people are starting to invest, but they face these problems:
- **Low Financial Knowledge**: Many don’t understand how investments like mutual funds or stocks work.
- **Lack of Personal Advice**: Most financial advice is generic and doesn’t fit individual needs.
- **Poor Spending Awareness**: People often don’t track their expenses, so they don’t know how much they can invest.
- **Scalability Issue**: Traditional financial advisors can’t help millions of people at once.

## Key Features
1. **Expense Tracker**:
   - Upload your bank statements or UPI transaction data.
   - Automatically sorts your expenses (e.g., food, travel, shopping).
   - Shows your spending patterns with easy-to-read charts.

2. **AI Financial Chatbot**:

   - Get personalized investment advice based on your spending and goals.
   - Learn financial concepts in an easy way.

   - Provides educational content to help you understand your choices.
